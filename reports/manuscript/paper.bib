  title    = {Inference and Prediction Diverge in Biomedicine},
  author   = {Bzdok, Danilo and Engemann, Denis and Thirion, Bertrand},
  abstract = {In the 20th century, many advances in biological knowledge and
            evidence-based medicine were supported by p values and
            accompanying methods. In the early 21st century, ambitions toward
            precision medicine place a premium on detailed predictions for
            single individuals. The shift causes tension between traditional
            regression methods used to infer statistically significant group
            differences and burgeoning predictive analysis tools suited to
            forecast an individual's future. Our comparison applies linear
            models for identifying significant contributing variables and for
            finding the most predictive variable sets. In systematic data
            simulations and common medical datasets, we explored how
            variables identified as significantly relevant and variables
            identified as predictively relevant can agree or diverge. Across
            analysis scenarios, even small predictive performances typically
            coincided with finding underlying significant statistical
            relationships, but not vice versa. More complete understanding of
            different ways to define ``important'' associations is a
            prerequisite for reproducible research and advances toward
            personalizing medical care.},

  title    = {Encoding and decoding in {fMRI}},
  author   = {Naselaris, Thomas and Kay, Kendrick N and Nishimoto, Shinji and
            Gallant, Jack L},
  abstract = {Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly
            sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in
            BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear
            classification, a simple technique for decoding information about
            experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an
            array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based
            encoding model, which describes the information about the
            stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single
            voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations:
            encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses
            activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in
            practice these two operations are often confused, and their
            respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear.
            Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify
            the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that
            encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate
            some of the most common questions about how information is
            represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models
            offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding
            model can in principle provide a complete functional description
            of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only
            a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to
            derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is
            much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding
            model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by
            estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends
            by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.},

  abstract     = {Multiple human behaviors improve early in life, peaking in young adulthood, and declining thereafter. Several properties of brain structure and function progress similarly across the lifespan. Cognitive and neuroscience research has approached aging primarily using associations between a few behaviors, brain functions, and structures. Because of this, the multivariate, global factors relating brain and behavior across the lifespan are not understood. We investigated the global patterns of associations between 334 behavioral and clinical measures and 376 brain structural connections in 594 individuals across the lifespan. A single-axis associated changes in multiple behavioral domains and brain structural connections (r=0.5808). Individual variability within the single association-axis well predicted the subjects age (r=0.6275). Representational similarity analysis evidenced global patterns of interactions across multiple brain networks systems and behavioral domains. Results show that a global process of human aging is well captured by multivariate data fusion approach. [147]Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.}

	abstract = {In order to obtain the sample sizes needed for robustly reproducible effects, it is often necessary to acquire data at multiple sites using different MRI scanners. This poses a challenge for investigators to account for the variance due to scanner, as balanced sampling is often not an option. Similarly, longitudinal studies must deal with known and unknown changes to scanner hardware and software over time. In this manuscript, we have explored scanner-related differences in the dataset recently released by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) project, a multi-site, longitudinal study of children age 9-10. We demonstrate that scanner manufacturer, model, as well as the individual scanner itself, are detectable in the resting and task-based fMRI results of the ABCD dataset. We further demonstrate that these differences can be harmonized using an empirical Bayes approach known as ComBat. We argue that accounting for scanner variance, including even minor differences in scanner hardware or software, is crucial for any analysis.},
